# CodeBEAM SF Day 1

## Old Ideas Made New
- TODO: Find a link to this video.

## Update from Elixir Core Team

### Elixir 1.9
- Elixir on 6-month release schedule.
- Introduced releases and related config changes, logger improvements, calendar
  types improvements.

#### Releases
- self contained directory for deployment
  - all of your code, Erlang runtime, deps, etc.

- MIX_ENV=prod mix release

- standardized way to manage lifecycle of aplication
  - bin/my_app start|start_iex|restart|stop
  - bin/my_app rpc|remote|eval
  - bin/my_app daemon|daemon_iex|install

#### Why Releases?
- code preloading
- configuration and customization
- self-contained (no *need* for Docker)
- multiple releases if using umbrella setup or poncho (?)

#### Configuration
- config/config.exs (compile time configuration)
- config/releases.exs (runtime configuration)
- rel/vm.args.eex (flags for VM -- garbage collection, etc.)

### Elixir 1.10
- Released in January 2020
- 900+ contributors
- 10_000+ packages on hex.pm
- millions of downloads

#### Features
- Requires OTP 21+
  - allows integration with new OTP logger
  - Elixir and OTP logger are one in the same.
- release improvements
- easier sorting
- `is_struct/1` and `is_map_key/2` guard functions

#### Sorting
```
iex> Enum.sort(["banana", "apple", "pineapple"])
["apple", "banana", "pineapple"]

iex> Enum.sort(["banana", "apple", "pineapple"], &>=/2)
["pineapple", "banana", "apple"]
```

This didn't work for dates because Erlang sorting is structural.
Introduced built-in support for sort functions based on type, with atoms for
direction.

#### Configuration
- Added `compile_env` to specify config at compile time, and will warn if
  changed at runtime.

#### Compiler Tracing
- cross-reference database for mapping function calls, references, structs, etc.
  wasn't exposed for tooling.
- Added plugin system to access this.
- easier development of libraries like [Boundary](https://github.com/sasa1977/boundary)

#### Improved ExUnit diffing
- assertions on patterns, not just equality comparisons.

### Elixir 1.11
- Scheduled for June 2020
- Added `Calendar.strftime/3`
- `is_struct/2` and `map.field` in guards.
- More logger improvements
- Enforces application boundaries.

#### Future Versions
- deprecations on function calls.
- Changes to AST in Elixir 2.0

#### Logger
- Support all levels of OTP logger

### Cool Community Projects
- HexDiff
- Lumen - WebAssembly implementation in Elixir.
- Mint - functional HTTP client
- ElixirLS
- Configuration with [vapor](https://github.com/keathley/vapor) and
    [skogsra](https://github.com/gmtprime/skogsra)
- Checkout Nerves and Broadway.

## Preventing Double Billing
- Missed error detection and notification, fault tolerance sections.
- Create `entity_hash` from data and create unique index on it.
- Use bloom filters to quickly determine if a billing has never been seen
  [bloomex](https://github.com/gmcabrita/bloomex)
  - This can be added to the storage module.
- If the database is temporarily unavailable, use retries with backoff.

## Tactics for Developing Scalable Robust Intelligent Systems

### 2030 China Challenge
- National security
- employment: on the verge of universal intelligent systems, which would mean
  employment would be there, not elsewhere.
- civil liberties: if China controls these systems, they likely won't be good
  for civil liberties.

### Project Liftoff
- To provide secure, universal intelligent systems.
- Analogous to Project Apollo.
  - Real achievement wasn't planting a flag on the moon, it was building the
    tools and technology to do so.

### Hologlasses
- Will be as popular in 10 years as smartphones are today.
- Used for just about anything, even for things smartphones don't work for.

### Actor System
- Includes N `primordial` actors that are created when the system is created.
  Can send messages to and receive messages from the outside.
- Event induction allows you to prove properties of concurrent systems.

### Actor Behavior Induction.
- Instead of an actor system, we can prove properties of individual actors.

### By End of the Decade
- Millions of actor core
- Quadrillions of actors.
- Fundamentally different architecture from Von Neumann computing.

### Booting up over the internet
- We have a controller, which can accept BOOT, SHUTDOWN and UPGRADE messages.
- A BOOT message includes an image, is signed, and returns a TerminationReport
- SHUTDOWN returns void.
- UPGRADE returns void.

### Using Actors for Inference
- We can build ontologies using billions of actors sending information back and
  forth.
- We can put in all of our information into this system, and move away from an
  application-based system, to one that can make inferences based on this
  information.

### Citadel Information Integration
- This can't be done in datacenters, instead, will need to be done locally.
- We can pass messages back and forth between data centers to get the
  information that doesn't need to be secure and private (ex. medical,
  financial, etc.)
- Citadels would be a network of your personal devices (car, router,
  hologlasses, etc.)
- How does this deal with unreliable networks?

### Business Model
- Advertising without mass surveillance.
- Controlling what information is shared to ensure that advertising is relevant
  and not a nuisance.

### Military Applications
- Already testing this.
- Adversaries can disrupt communications, so they can't rely on continuous,
  reliable communication to data centers.
