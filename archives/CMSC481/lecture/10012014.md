## Pipelined Protocols
* Pipelining: sender allows multiple "in-flight", yet to be acknowledged
    packets.
    * range of sequence numbers must be increased, and buffering must happen at
        the sender and receiver.
* Two forms of pipelining exist: go-Back-N, and selective repeat.

### Go-Back-N
* The sender is allowed to send N packets in quick succession, with a timeout
    for the oldest unacknowledged packet. When the timer runs out, all unacknowledged packets are
    retransmitted.
* This has support for duplicate acknowledgements.

### Selective Repeat

## TCP : An overview
TCP is a connection between sender and receiver. It provides a reliable,
in-order byte stream, tat is pipelined, supports full duplex data, is connection
oriented and flow controlled. These qualities are guaranteed to any services
running on top of it.

### TCP segment structure:
A tcp segment consists of a source IP, destination IP, sequence numner,
acknowledgement number, options, checksum, data, etc.

TCP segments have pseudoheaders.
