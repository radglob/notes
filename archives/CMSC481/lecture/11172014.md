## OSPF

OSPF is a routing architecture. It is divided into autonomous systems that
communicate with each other. Each system is under the control of a single
entity, such as an ISP, university, private corporation, etc.

OSPF finds routes within an autonomous system. First, it divides the system into
areas. Each is numbered, starting at 0. The first area is also called the
**backbone**. Each area shares a common router, which are called 
**area border routers**. They play a particular role in the areas they are connected to. 
Routers that are not border routers are called **internal routers**. There is a single
router in the system that can talk to routers in another system. This is called
the **autonomous system boundary router**.

OSPF headers include a version number, type, message length, source address,
area id, checksum, authentication type, and an authentication value. It can be
confirmed, unlike RIP.
