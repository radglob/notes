## Normalization again!

Why do we normalize?
* reduce redundancy
* reduce inconsistency
* improve performance.

When should we not normalize?
* if the result impedes performance.

## Normalization Forms:
* First normal form: attributes are atomic.
* Second normal form: if there is a non-key attribute that is not dependent on
    the candidate key, it should be decomposed.
* Third normal form: when a non-key attribute is not functionally dependent on
    the candidate key but instead another non-key attribute.
* BCNF: A special form of third normal form. If a -> b, then a should be a super
    key.
* Fourth normal form: At least 3 attributes, for each value of the first
    attribute there are a set of vaules for the second and third attributes and the
    second and third attribute values are independent from each other.
