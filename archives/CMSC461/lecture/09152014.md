# Databases - 09/15/2014 - SQL

SQL is one of the most used languages in the world. It's useful for a lot of
stuff.

Originally named *sequel* and was part of the System-R project at IBM. Has since
become standardized, although not all SQL databases implement the spec
completely.

It provides a DDL, DML, integrity, view definition, transaction control,
authorization, etc.

## DDL
The SQL DDL allows the specification about relations.

## Domain Types:
* char
* varchar
* etc...

## Errors and defining sizes
If you define a size to be too small, it may be an issue.

## Creating tables
```SQL
create table instructor(
    ID    char(5)
    name  varchar(20)
    ...
```

## Integrity Constraints
You can define primary keys for tables, which values cannot be null, etc.
