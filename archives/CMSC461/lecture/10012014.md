# Databases - 10/01/2014 - More on E-R Model

## The Entity-Relationship Diagram
* double lines mean total participation

## Attributes
* composite: name (first, last)
* multivalued: telephone(work, home)
* derived: age (today - DOB)

## Roles
Entities in this model have roles which describe who/what they are relative to
other entities. For example, an advisor could be a faculty member with
relationship to students.

## Relationship Types:
* one-to-one
* one-to-many
* many-to-many

## Weak Entity Sets
Weak entity sets must have an identifying relationship: something that
associates it with another entity. In E-R diagrams, we underline the
discriminator with a dashed line.

These are discussed relative to **this** model, not the relational model.
