# Databases - 10/08/2014 - ER Diagram to Working Database

## Aggregation Revisited
You can encapsulate relationships, making them abstract entities and allowing
the creation of relationships between relationships, using the primary keys from
each relation. Note that this isn't frequently done.

## Relational Database Design
We want to move from an E-R diagram to a set of relations, removing redundancy.
We want a complete, efficient design. We can obtain this with normalization.

### Combining Schemas
Say we have two schemas: department and instructor. Would we want to combine the
two? Not without some modification, as there is likely some redundancy. We want
to avoid repetition.

We need to think about how to decompose relations. We do so by examining
functional dependencies. But not all decompositions are good. We can lose
information as a result. This is called a **lossy decomposition**.

We want what is called a **lossless join decomposition**. Suppose some relation
(a, b, c) decomposed into (a, b) and (b, c). When we join the decomposed
relations, we haven't lost any data.

## First Normal Form (1NF)

The domain is atomic is elements are considered indivisible units. Atomicity is
actually a property of how elements of the domain are used.

### What's atomic?
* address - no
* phone number - maybe
* course_id - yes
* student name - maybe
* SSN - yes
* ISBN - yes
