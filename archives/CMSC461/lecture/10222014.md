# Databases - 10/22/2014 - Multivalued Decomposition and More.

## Multivalued Dependencies:

What happens when we have data repetition, even in BCNF form? You need to use
4th normal form (4NF).

a -> -> b is how multivalued dependencies are expressed, concisely.

### Theory
If a -> b, then a -> -> b. That is, every functional dependency is also a
multivalued dependency.

A relation schema R is in 4th normal form with respect to a set D of functional
and multivalued dependencies if for all multivalued...

## Design Process
Given a schema R, which we assume to have been generated by an E-R diagram, we
use normalization to decomposose into smaller relations. If it was carefully
designed, we can generate tables from that. This won't usually happen. 

We may actually end up denormalizing data for performance reasons.
