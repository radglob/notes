# Databases - 11/03/2014 - Indexing and Hashing

There are two basic types of indexing:
* ordered: search keys stored in sorted order.
* hashed

## Ordered Indices:
Records are stored with a primary index/clustering index. Files are in
sequential order. A secondary index is a non-clustering index.

An index-sequential file is a file with a clustering index on the search key.

Indices can be dense (index record for each record in the file) or sparse
(opposite of dense).

In sparse index files, records have to be in sequential order.

## Multilevel Index:
Employed if the primary index does not fit in memory. Uses inner and outer
indices, which segment the data into blocks.

## B+ Tree Index Files
An alternative to indexed-sequential files, which have performance degradation
when files get large.
