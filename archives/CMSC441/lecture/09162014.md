# Algorithms - 09/16/2014 - Quick Sort

## Quick Sort
Last time we looked at heap sort, which is O(n log n).

Merge sort was nice, except the extra merge step took O(n) time and needed extra
space?

What if we could do something similar without the merge step?

```
partition(A, p, r) {
  x = A[r];
  i = p - 1;
  for j = p to r - 1 {
    if A[j] <= x {
      i++;
      swap A[i] w/ A[j];
    }
  swap A[i + 1] w/ A[r];
  return i + 1;
}
```

Partition is &Theta;(n)

This is different from traditional implementations of partition - this version
is easier to analyze and doesn't use do-while loops.

```
quicksort(A, p, r) {
  if p >= r { return };
  q = partition(A, p, r);
  quicksort(A, p, q-1);
  quicksort(A, q+1, r);
```

As is, this gives us a worst case running time of &Theta;(n<sup>2</sup>). How do
we fix this? Use randomized partitioning.

```
randomized_partition(A, p, r) {
  pick item i from [p .. r] randomly.
  swap A[i] w/ A[r].
  return partition(A, p, r);
```

Random variables are convenient to work with due to linearity of expectations:
The expected value of the sum of random variables is the sum of the expected
values of random variables.

In quicksort, all comparisons are with the pivot item. If x<sub>i</sub> and
x<sub>j</sub> are compared, then one of them is a pivot. If x<sub>i</sub> and
x<sub>j</sub> are on different sides of a partition, they will not be compared.

Using randomized partitioning, we find that quicksort is &Theta;(n log n).
