Clarification:

When you say f(n) -> O(g(n)) : f(n) "&lt;" g(n).
When you say f(n) -> o(g(n)) : f(n) "&lt;&lt;&lt;" g(n).

## Recurrence Relations:
1. Substitution: I know the answer, prove by induction.
2. Iteration / Recurrence Tree
3. Master Theorem (covering today)

### Substitution
Suppose we have the recurrence relation T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n, and we want to prove
T(n) &le; cn<sup>2</sup>.

What do we do when induction fails? You can change the induction hypothesis,
making it stronger or weaker.

### Iteration/Recurrence Tree
In recurrence, we keep extending our equation until we can find a pattern to
exploit.

If you hit an endpoint that doesn't make sense (e.g. log n = 0), choose a
different value.

### Master Theorem
This is the easiest way to solve recurrence relations, but it is not always the
most appropriate choice.

Let a be greater than or equal to 1, b greater than 1 be constants. Let f(n) be a function
and let T(n) be defined on the non-negative integers by: T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n).

There are three cases, which do not cover all possibilities. The Master Theorem
may not work for all problems.

It asks you to compare two values: n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup> and f(n). Which
is larger?
