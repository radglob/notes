## Math Review

log(ab) = log a + log b

log(a/b) = log a - log b

log(a<sup>b</sup>) = b * log a

log<sub>b</sub>a = log a / log b

You can use these identities to make estimations about other functions.

n<sup>0.00001</sup> vs. log n: which is bigger?

Take the log of both sides: 0.00001 log n vs. log log n. The former grows much
faster.

Know [geometric series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series) and
[harmonic series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)).

The harmonic series is interesting because it is &#920;(log n).

## Analyzing the Running Time of Recursive Programs

Consider merge sort, a classic recursive program.

```
merge_sort(A) {
    merge_sort(0, A/2 - 1)
    merge_sort(A/2, A)
    merge()
}
```

T(n) = 2 * T(n/2) + c * n for n &le; 10

We can bound this function a number of ways:
* Substitution: must already know the answer.
* Iteration/Recursion
* Master Theorem

### Substitution

T(m) &le; (c*m log m) + m, for smaller m

T(n) = 2 * T(n/2) + c*n

  &le; 2 * [c*(n/2)log(n/2) + n/2] + c*n

  = cnlog(n/2) + n + cn

  = cn(log n - ~~log 2~~) + n + cn
  
  = cnlogn - ~~cn~~ + n + ~~cn~~

  &le; cnlog(n) + n
