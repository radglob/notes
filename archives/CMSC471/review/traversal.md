# Graph Traversal Review

Graph traversal algorithms are pretty important in general. Two algorithms to
focus on are Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS).

## Depth First Search
Depth first search starts at the root node of some graph, and explores as far as
possible into a branch before backtracking. Worst case performance is O(|E|) and
worst case space complexity is O(|V|), where **E** is the number of edges and
**V** is the number of vertices in the graph.

Here's a Python implementation.

```python
def DFS()
```

## Breadth First Search
